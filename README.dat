# Image Descriptor

Imagedescriptor is a Python-based web application leveraging the power of deep learning and natural language processing to provide captivating insights into images. With this, users can upload their images or provide a link to an image, and the system will analyze it using the YOLOv8 model from KerasCV.

The YOLOv8 model detects objects within the image, providing a comprehensive list of identified objects. But the magic doesn't stop there. GeminiVision goes further by harnessing the capabilities of Gemini AI to craft beautiful and aesthetic captions that encapsulate the essence of the image.

## Features 
Image Upload or Link: Users can either upload images directly or provide a URL link to the image they want to analyze.
Object Detection: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model from KerasCV to detect objects within the image, generating a detailed list of identified objects.
Gemini AI Captioning: The list of detected objects is passed to Gemini AI, where advanced natural language processing algorithms generate elegant and aesthetic captions for the image.

## How it works?
The image whose description has to be made is accessed through an iimage address. Keras modules access these image and uses a pretrained YoloV8 model for object recognition.
Output of the prediction of model generates a list of object present in the image.
The list is passed to a gemini text-davinci model which takes the list as input and generates  a caption based on the list.
The style in which the caption should be customimsed with the help of prompt.
An input image of a cat playing with ball after object detection looks like ![this](https://github.com/adwaithhr/ImageDescriptor/blob/main/cat.jpg).
The output from the gemini.py looks like ![this](https://github.com/adwaithhr/ImageDescriptor/blob/main/output.jpg).
## Libraries used
Python 3.9.11
KerasCV 3.0
YOLOv8
Gemini - text-davinci-003
## How to configure
Replace the link of your image with the current link in the main.py file and run it.
It should produce a description of the given image.
